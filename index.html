<!-- Build a page with a form containing input fields where users may enter several of their favorite things. -->
<!-- Then, write code that gathers each of these form input values and places them into one array. -->

<!-- After this is done, use your site to practice targeting and moving elements between arrays: -->
<!-- Use square bracket notation to access the second, first, and third elements of the original array of favorite things. -->
<!-- Then, use Array.prototype.push() to add only these elements (2nd, 1st, and 3rd) to a brand new array. -->
<!-- Finally, display this new array in your page's HTML as list items in a <ul> tag. Use the document.createElement() and Element.append() or Element.prepend() methods to create and add elements to your webpage. -->
